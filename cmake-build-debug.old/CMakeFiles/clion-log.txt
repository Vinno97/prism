CMake Warning at /cygdrive/c/Users/vince/.CLion2018.2/system/cygwin_cmake/share/cmake-3.12.0/Modules/Platform/CYGWIN.cmake:15 (message):
  CMake no longer defines WIN32 on Cygwin!

  (1) If you are just trying to build this project, ignore this warning or
  quiet it by setting CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=0 in your environment or in
  the CMake cache.  If later configuration or build errors occur then this
  project may have been written under the assumption that Cygwin is WIN32.
  In that case, set CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=1 instead.

  (2) If you are developing this project, add the line

    set(CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32 0) # Remove when CMake >= 2.8.4 is required

  at the top of your top-level CMakeLists.txt file or set the minimum
  required version of CMake to 2.8.4 or higher.  Then teach your project to
  build on Cygwin without WIN32.

CMake Error at Prism.Engine/CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindAssimp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Assimp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Assimp" with any
  of the following names:

    AssimpConfig.cmake
    assimp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Assimp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Assimp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Assimp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
